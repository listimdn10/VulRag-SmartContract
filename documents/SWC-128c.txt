vulnerable code:
pragma solidity ^0.4.25;

contract DosOneFunc {

 address[] listAddresses;

 function ifillArray() public returns (bool){
 if(listAddresses.length<1500) {

 for(uint i=0;i<350;i++) {
 listAddresses.push(msg.sender);
 }
 return true;

 } else {
 listAddresses = new address[](0);
 return false;
 }
 }
}


Abstract purpose:
The purpose of the code snippet is to fill an array with the sender's address in batches, up to a maximum of 1500 elements, and reset the array if it reaches that limit.

Detail Behaviors: 
1. Check if the array length is less than 1500.
2. If less than 1500, add the sender's address to the array in batches of 350.
3. Return true after filling the array.
4. If the array length reaches 1500, reset the array to an empty array.
5. Return false after resetting the array.

fixed code:
pragma solidity ^0.4.25;

contract DosOneFunc {
    address[] listAddresses;
    uint public maxBatchSize = 50; // Limit batch processing

    function fillArray(uint batchSize) public returns (bool) {
        require(batchSize > 0 && batchSize <= maxBatchSize, "Invalid batch size");

        if (listAddresses.length < 1500) {
            for (uint i = 0; i < batchSize; i++) {
                listAddresses.push(msg.sender);
            }
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    function clearBatch(uint batchSize) public {
        require(batchSize > 0 && batchSize <= maxBatchSize, "Invalid batch size");
        require(listAddresses.length > 0, "Array is already empty");

        uint deleteCount = batchSize > listAddresses.length ? listAddresses.length : batchSize;
        for (uint i = 0; i < deleteCount; i++) {
            listAddresses[listAddresses.length - 1] = address(0);
            listAddresses.length--;
        }
    }

    function getListSize() public view returns (uint) {
        return listAddresses.length;

Abstract Vulnerability Description: The vulnerability presents as a Denial of Service (DoS) condition arising from exceeding the computational resource constraints imposed by the blockchain, specifically due to unchecked growth of data structures within the contract. This occurs when a function attempts to perform operations that require more gas than the maximum allowed by the network for a single transaction, potentially locking out future interactions with the contract.

Trigger Action: Initiating the function that adds multiple entries to a data structure beyond a network block's gas capacity, risking transaction failure and preventing the function from executing successfully as the data structure approaches its upper gas threshold.

            Detailed Vulnerability Description: 1. **Vulnerability Type**: SWC-128 - DoS with Block Gas Limit.

2. **Root Cause**: The function `ifillArray`, as originally written, attempts to add a large number of elements (350 times the callerâ€™s address) to an array `listAddresses` in a single transaction. As the size of the array increases, so does the gas cost associated with each additional transaction that modifies the array. Consequently, if the gas required to process a transaction exceeds the network's block gas limit, the transaction will fail, thereby effectively causing a DoS attack on the function itself.

3. **Manifestation**: Over time, as the array grows close to its threshold of 1500 addresses, transactions calling `ifillArray` become susceptible to exceeding the block gas limit. This inadvertently blocks further interaction with the function as the operation cannot be completed within a reasonable gas amount.

4. **Potential Impact**: The inability to call `ifillArray` or the contract getting stuck if this function is part of a broader critical operational logic within a decentralized application (dApp).

###
            Solution Description: 1. **Reduction of Batch Size**: The critical modification involved controlling the number of iterations in the loop that appends addresses to the `listAddresses` array. By introducing a `batchSize` parameter and limiting it through a moderate `maxBatchSize`, the computation per transaction is confined to a manageable number, ensuring that the cost of gas operations remains within the block gas limit.

2. **Function to Clear the Array**: A separate method, `clearBatch`, was introduced. This function also respects the `maxBatchSize` limit and iteratively clears a defined number of entries from the end of the array. This provides a controlled way to manage and reduce the array size without consuming excessive gas.

3. **Use of Require Statements**: The solution incorporates `require` statements to enforce constraints on the `batchSize` parameter. This validation step is crucial for ensuring that the contract's users provide permissible values for batch operations, minimizing the risk of erroneous or exploitative input.

4. **Improved Gas Usage**: By effectively slicing operations into smaller, more predictable units, the solution promotes economic gas usage and prevents potential DoS scenarios by keeping executions within acceptable gas limits.
