Abstract purpose: To implement a relayer smart contract that manages the execution of transactions on a target contract.

Detail Behaviors:
1. The Relayer contract stores transactions in a mapping and executes them by relaying the data to the Target contract.
2. Each transaction is marked as executed to prevent duplicate execution.
3. The relay function calls the execute function on the Target contract using the provided data and returns the success status.

Abstract Vulnerability Description: The vulnerability stems from inadequate safeguards against gas limit manipulations, leading to premature halting of sub-call executions. This can allow an adversary to disrupt or censor functions by intentionally causing gas exhaustion during execution, ultimately inducing denial-of-service conditions.

Trigger Action: The initiation occurs when an attacker specifies a gas limit that is sufficient for initial processing but insufficient for the complete execution of a relayed call, leading to an intentional failure in completing the target contract transaction.

            Detailed Vulnerability Description: **

The vulnerability in question pertains to an insufficient gas griefing attack, indexed under SWC-126. Within the context of the provided smart contract, the `Relayer` contract accepts transaction data and subsequently attempts to relay this to a `Target` contract via a low-level `call` function. This introduces a critical risk when the relayed call does not execute successfully due to insufficient gas being provided.

This vulnerability exploits the mechanism of gas usage during a transaction to intentionally cause sub-call failures. By controlling the gas limit, an attacker (often termed as the 'forwarder') can cause the execution of the relay process to halt prematurely within the `Target` contract. If the call fails mid-execution due to depleted gas, it could lead to either a complete transaction revert or continuation, depending on how the relayer is configured. In this specific case, the attack could originate from a transaction where the user submits just enough gas for the relayer's processing but insufficient for the target call. This manipulation can be used censoriously to block transactions, creating a denial-of-service-like condition.

**
            Solution Description: **

The remedy implemented involves augmenting the `relay` function to include an additional argument, `_gasLimit`. This approach permits the forwarder to specify a minimum gas requirement for executing the target function, which mitigates the risk of failure due to insufficient gas.

In the adjusted implementation:

1. **Signature Addition**: The function signature of the `execute` function in the `Target` contract now necessitates the gas limit (`_gasLimit`) as a parameter.

2. **Pre-check Requirement**: Within the `Target` contract, a `require` statement is added to check if the remaining gas (`gasleft()`) is sufficient, i.e., greater than or equal to `_gasLimit`. If not, the function call is halted with an exception error ('not enough gas').

3. **Gas Limitation Control**: By enabling specification of gas limits directly in the contract's logic, the authors have applied a proactive control to ensure necessary gas availability, thereby reducing griefing opportunities.
