contract AssertConstructor {
 function AssertConstructor() public {
 assert(false);
 }
}



Abstract purpose: The purpose of the above code snippet is to create a contract with a constructor function that uses the assert statement to trigger an exception.

Detail Behaviors:
1. The contract "AssertConstructor" has a constructor function.
2. The constructor function asserts false, triggering an exception when the contract is deployed.
