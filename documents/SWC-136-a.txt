Abstract purpose: The purpose of the code snippet is to create a contract that allows two players to make a bet on whether the sum of their chosen numbers is odd or even, with the winner receiving the bet amount.

Detail Behaviors:
1. Players can place a bet by calling the 'play' function and stating their chosen number.
2. The contract checks that the bet amount is 1 ether and assigns the player's address and number to the respective structure.
3. Once two players have placed their bets, the 'selectWinner' function is called to determine the winner based on the sum of the chosen numbers.
4. The winner receives the contract's balance as a reward, and the player data is reset for a new round.
