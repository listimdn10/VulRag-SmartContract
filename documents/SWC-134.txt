Abstract purpose: Analyzing a smart contract that utilizes low-level call functions for transferring value and making external function calls.

Detail Behaviors: 
1. Transfer a specific amount of ether to the address `_callable`.
2. Send a specific amount of ether to the address `_callable`.
3. Make a low-level `call` with a specified gas limit of 10000.
4. Call the `callMe` function of the `ICallable` contract with a specified gas limit of 10000.

**Abstract Vulnerability Description:**  
The vulnerability arises from using value transfer methods that have fixed gas stipends, which can lead to operational failures when network gas costs increase due to protocol updates or hard forks. These methods impose rigid limits on the transaction's gas usage, making the contract inflexible and prone to breaking changes when gas requirements increase, thus jeopardizing its functionality and reliability.

**Trigger Action:**  
Initiating a value transfer using functions (`transfer()` or `send()`) that enforce a fixed and limited gas allocation to the recipient's fallback function.

            Detailed Vulnerability Description: **

The original code snippet contains a critical vulnerability, classified under SWC-134, which pertains to the use of the `transfer()` and `send()` functions for value transfers. These functions inherently forward a
            Solution Description: **

The proposed modification adopts a more flexible and resilient approach to value transfers by utilizing the `.call()` function instead. This approach eliminates the fixed gas stipend limitation inherent in `transfer()` and `send()`, offering a customizable gas allocation options for the transaction, thus averting potential disruptions due to increased gas costs. Key elements of the solution include:

1. **Transition from `transfer()`/`send()` to `.call()`:** The `.call()` method is employed for executing value transfers. This method doesn't limit the gas stipend and adapts to changes in the gas requirements, providing a pragmatic solution to evolving network costs.

2. **Validation through Return Values:** Each invocation of `.call()` captures the success of the operation by evaluating the boolean return value. This is followed by a `require()` statement, ensuring that the transaction reverts in case of failure, thereby maintaining the integrity of operations and providing explicit error handling.

3. **Enhanced Flexibility with Gas Simulation:** The modified functions simulate the gas limits while retaining control over exceptional states. By provisioning an appropriate gas amount using `.call()`, it gives developers the potential to manage gas allocation dynamically based on current network fees, preemptively addressing fluctuations in gas costs post-hard fork.
