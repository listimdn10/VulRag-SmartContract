contract AssertMinimal {
 function run() public {
 assert(false);
 }
}


Abstract purpose:
This code snippet is aiming to demonstrate the usage of the assert function in a simple Solidity smart contract.

Detail Behaviors:
1. Defines a Solidity contract named AssertMinimal.
2. Contains a function named run that is accessible publicly.
3. Inside the run function, an assert statement is used to trigger an error condition intentionally.
